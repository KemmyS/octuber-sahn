                    <p class="text-start ">
                        I was born and raised in Sierra Leone.
                        A beautiful country on the west coast of the African continent.

                    <p class="text-start ">
                        My programming journey started during the COVID-19 lock down, and the learning 
                        curve was not without it challenges,but it has been, and still remains a thrilling filled with so much discoveries.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="text-start ">
                       Coming from a medical background - Surgery to be specific,
                         I thrive in somewhat unstable environments,
                        and always learning new ways to work efficiently, which has served to be my greatest asset in transitioning into Programming

                        It might have crossed your mind as you are reading this, why the drastic switch of careers from the operating room to coding?
                        Well, frankly 2020 was definitely a year of great introspection for all of us, and I was no different.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-start ">
                        I have always been a curious person and enjoy work that challenges me. 
                        That's what first drew me to become a certified surgical assistant,
                        the ability to solve complex issues, different surgical produces presented different challenges which was what kept me going. 
                        This was no different from programming challenges, the ability of solving the inevitable issues for a better user experience, 
                        creating something from start to finish is what gets me excited.

                        <p class="text-start ">
                        So, after years of learning, providing, and applying solutions in the operating room,
                        I am looking to do the same as a programmer.
                        I am a lifelong learner and would like to continue refining my skills with the right company
